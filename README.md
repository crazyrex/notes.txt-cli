# notes.txt

Simple shell script for managing plain text note files (inspired by
[todo.txt](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli)).

## Rationale

I like Google Keep, but I dislike being tied to a single vendor's platform. I
also dislike Google spying on me all the time. With Notes.txt, everything is
just kept in plain text files. How you transfer them between devices is up to
you (e.g. Dropbox, [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/), mounted FTP filesystem,
rsync, scp, git repo, etc.). Your data is wholly owned by you, and as plain
text it is completely future proof and editable with your preferred text
editor.
