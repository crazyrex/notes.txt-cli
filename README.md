# notes.txt

Simple shell script for managing plain text note files (inspired by
[todo.txt](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli)).

## Rationale

I like Google Keep, but I dislike being tied to a single vendor's platform. I
also dislike Google spying on me all the time. With Notes.txt, everything is
just kept in plain text files. How you transfer them between machines is up to
you (e.g. Dropbox, mounted FTP filesystem, rsync, scp, git repo, etc.). Your data is wholly
owned by you, and it completely future proof. You can also use the text editor you
prefer.
